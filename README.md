# EeveeSpotify

**Updated and maintained by Skye - Current Version 9.1.22**

**Last updated 2/13/26**

This tweak makes Spotify think you have a Premium subscription, granting free listening, just like Spotilife, and provides some additional features like custom lyrics.

> [!NOTE]
> The original EeveeSpotify repository was disabled due to a [DMCA takedown](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2025/08/2025-08-14-spotify.md). This repository will not contain IPA packages in the repo itself.

## Custom Lyrics Support

**Spotify 9.1.22** - Full custom lyrics functionality is available with the following provider:

- **Musixmatch** ✅ (Currently enabled)

> [!NOTE]
> Other providers (Genius, LRCLIB, PetitLyrics) are available in the code but disabled in build.*

## The History

In January 2024, Spotilife, the only tweak to get Spotify Premium, stopped working on new Spotify versions. I decompiled Spotilife, reverse-engineered Spotify, intercepted requests, etc., and created this tweak.

## Restrictions

Please refrain from opening issues about the following features, as they are server-sided and will **NEVER** work:

- Very High audio quality
- Native playlist downloading (you can download podcast episodes though)
- Jam (hosting a Spotify Jam and joining it remotely requires Premium; only joining in-person works)
- AI DJ/Playlist
- Spotify Connect (When using Spotify Connect, the device will act as a remote control and stream directly to the connected device. This is a server-sided limitation and is beyond the control of EeveeSpotify, so it will behave as if you have a Free subscription while using this feature.)

**Note:** Spotify 9.1.x runs with full features including custom lyrics via Musixmatch.

## Lyrics Support (Spotify 9.1.0 only)

EeveeSpotify replaces Spotify monthly limited lyrics with one of the following four lyrics providers:

- Genius: Offers the best quality lyrics, provides the most songs, and updates lyrics the fastest. Does not and will never be time-synced.

- LRCLIB: The most open service, offering time-synced lyrics. However, it lacks lyrics for many songs.

- Musixmatch: The service Spotify uses. Provides time-synced lyrics for many songs, but you'll need a user token to use this source. To obtain the token, download Musixmatch from the App Store, sign up, then go to Settings > Get help > Copy debug info, and paste it into EeveeSpotify alert. You can also extract the token using MITM.

- PetitLyrics: Offers plenty of time-synced Japanese and some international lyrics.

If the tweak is unable to find a song or process the lyrics, you'll see a "Couldn't load the lyrics for this song" message. The lyrics might be wrong for some songs when using Genius due to how the tweak searches songs. While I've made it work in most cases, kindly refrain from opening issues about it.

## How It Works

EeveeSpotify intercepts Spotify requests to load user data, deserializes it, and modifies the parameters in real-time. This method works incredibly stable across supported Spotify versions.

The tweak also sets `trackRowsEnabled` to `true`, allowing you to see track rows and liked tracks on artist pages just like with Premium.

## Installation

For sideloaded IPAs, we recommend using **Sideloadly** or certificate-based signing tools like **ksign** for best compatibility.

To open Spotify links in sideloaded app, use [OpenSpotifySafariExtension](https://github.com/BillyCurtis/OpenSpotifySafariExtension). Remember to activate it and allow access in Settings > Safari > Extensions.
